After the defeat of Antiochus III by the Romans at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC. e., as a result of which Antiochus was forced to abandon all the Asia Minor possessions of the Seleucids north of Taurus, both satraps declared their independence and proclaimed themselves kings. Thus, independent Armenian states arose, the formation of which was to a certain extent connected with the anti-Hellenistic reaction of the local population.

He ascended the Armenian throne at an auspicious moment. Roman power in Asia Minor was severely undermined by the military victories of Mithridates Eupator, the king of Pontus, who strengthened his power over the entire Black Sea region and threatened to expel the Romans from Asia altogether. Rome itself was on the brink of civil war between the factions of Marius and Sulla. In Syria, the Seleucid dynasty was on the brink of anarchy and collapse.

Armenia included the neighboring territories of Iberia, on the throne of which an Armenian prince was placed by Artashes, and Caucasian Albania. In 88 BC. e. Tigranes launched a successful war in the east against the king of Parthia. First of all, he won back 70 valleys from the Parthians, ceded to them as a ransom for his liberation. The region of Ahbak in Atropatene was also taken. The fall of the Seleucid state, the removal of the ruling Seleucid dynasty by representatives of the local aristocracy raised the question of power in the former Seleucid state. At first, it was supposed to invite the Egyptian Ptolemies or Mithridates VI Eupator to the throne of the Seleucids. However, the candidacy of Tigran II turned out to be preferable. In 83 BC. e. in the capital of the Seleucids - Antioch, Tigran II the Great was proclaimed king of Syria. In 71 BC. e.

In 631, Byzantine Armenia received the de facto status of a principality. At the council of the highest nobility, the Armenians elected themselves "ishkhan" - the first prince. This led to the transformation of relations between Armenians and Byzantium. From now on, Armenia was an autonomy - the head of the principality was elected by the local elites at the cathedral. However, his position was later approved by the Byzantine emperor. It was a form of vassal-suzerain relations. In 639, he becomes the primordial prince of united Armenia and remains so until 643.

The above claims were based on the principle of the historical belonging of the above territories to the ancient and early medieval Armenian states and on the ethnic principle, since most of the territories in question had either an Armenian majority or at least a significant presence of Armenians. On November 11, 1918, Javad Pasha received a communiqué from the British Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean, Vice Admiral Gough Kalthorpe, containing an unequivocal demand from the Allied High War Council to completely clear all the occupied territories of the Caucasus, including the territories of Kars and Batum, where after Mudros there were still about 50,000 Turkish troops. numerous Turkish officers were retained as instructors, but entire units of the 9th Army were only cosmetically reorganized to look more like a local militia and prevent the Armenian-Georgian seizure of the territories of Kars and Batum. One of the new state formations of this kind was the South-Western Caucasian Republic (SWKR), established in Kars shortly after Mudros. 1918 Armenian troops were stationed south of Yerevan to capture Sharur and Nakhichevan, while the local Tatar militias, despite some support from Turkey, were not prepared to resist Armenian expansion. However, the delay proved to be decisive. By this time, the pan-Turanist "Araks Republic" had been proclaimed in the disputed territory.

These Armenian plans sharply contradicted the aspirations of the local Muslim (mainly Turkic-Tatar) population, which constituted the absolute majority in the disputed territory after the ethnic cleansing of 1918. Nevertheless, in mid-December 1918, Armenian troops were deployed south of Yerevan to capture Sharur and Nakhichevan, while the local Tatar militias, despite some support from Turkey, were not ready to resist the Armenian expansion.

The Ottoman response was slow and delaying tactics were adopted to delay the evacuation of the above territories. Formally accepting the demands of the victorious allies, the Turks took certain measures to leave Kars and some other territories around it in the sphere of Turkish domination, as was the case in Azerbaijan, Dagestan and other areas captured by them by the end of the summer. , 1918 and had to leave after Mudros. Not only were numerous Turkish officers retained as instructors, but entire units of the 9th Army were only cosmetically reorganized to look more like a local militia and prevent the Armenian-Georgian seizure of the territories of Kars and Batum. One of the new state formations of this kind was the South-Western Caucasian Republic (SWKR), established in Kars shortly after Mudros. The pro-Turkish government of Fakhreddin (Erdogan) Pirioglu, formed in Kars on November 5, 1918, claimed de facto control not only over four regions of the Kars territory, but also over all the former Russian territories annexed by Turkey under the Batumi Treaty, including but not limited to Nakhichevan and Alexandropol districts of the Yerevan province, Akhaltsikhe and Akhalkalaki districts of the Tiflis province and Batumi region.

The next 8 months in Nagorno-Karabakh were marked by a complete failure of cooperation between the successive Armenian Assemblies and Sultanov, as well as incessant ethnic conflicts, which led to armed clashes between the local Armenian self-defense forces and the regular army of Azerbaijan, which included about 3000 Turkish soldiers still stationed in this area. At the same time, almost the entire Zangezur district was under the steady control of the Armenian military units and formations of General Andranik, who, being formally disloyal to the government in Yerevan, felt completely free in his actions and stopped all attempts by the regular armies of Turkey and Azerbaijan to take Zangezur under his control. .

The Armenian government also renounced claims to the Akhalkalaki district. The Georgian-Armenian war of 1918-1919 diverted the armed forces of both peoples from other important directions. This delayed the capture of Nakhijevan by Armenia. After the counteroffensive of the Georgian army in early April 1919, the British troops, already stationed in the Yerevan province, entered Kars on April 6-9. On April 10, 1919, the leaders of the SWKR were arrested and deported, and nine days later the city of Kars was handed over to the Armenian governor. By April 22, the Georgians completely crushed the resistance of the paramilitary formations of Serverbek in the Akhaltsikhe district and Ardagan district and took both districts under their control. The Southwestern Caucasian Republic was abolished, the Kars and Sarykamysh regions were annexed to the Democratic Republic of Armenia, and the Ardagan uyezd was ceded to Georgia. The British command in the Caucasus did not allow either Georgian or Armenian troops to enter the territory, including the Oltu (Olti) region, which was claimed by both peoples, and the Karakurt sector, which was claimed by Armenia, leaving it in the hands of local Muslim leaders.

The new British protectorate covered most of the Nakhichevan district (excluding the highlands), all of Sharur and even about 30% of Yerevan district to the Vedichay river. Although the area was excluded from the Armenian Republic, the British governorship put an end to the "Republic of Arasdayan". leaving most of the real administrative power to Jafar Quli Khan of Nakhichevan, while police functions were performed by a small British contingent.

You are probably wondering how it happened that no one used a nuclear bomb in the conflict region itself? So, as it turned out, all parties were bluffing, and none of them possessed real nuclear weapons. In general, every person who assembled a detachment of at least 100 people was able to establish control over any region. What’s more, you didn’t see what was going on in these parts in 2024, well, or in 2025, I’m already confused myself, and it doesn’t matter. During all these years, in fact, 4 military dictatorships were established, and two Kurdish formations. Galust Sahakyan and Tigran Arzakantsyan established power peacefully, and the Pontic-Armenian Confederation was established during lengthy negotiations. As for eastern Armenia, Shant has symbolically captured part of Kars, the PDP is trying to make a fortress out of Syunik, all other Armenian forces have established their control during some military operations, and the Turkish army has recently invaded Nakhichevan.
